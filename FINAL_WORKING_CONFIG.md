# ✅ Working Configuration

## What Works

Your scraper successfully scraped **80 unique jobs** with this configuration:

```json
{
  "searches": [
    {"keywords": "data scientist", "location": "Stockholm"},
    {"keywords": "machine learning engineer", "location": "Stockholm"}
  ],
  "scrape_settings": {
    "headless": true,
    "max_scroll_attempts": 3,
    "scroll_delay_ms": 2000,
    "page_load_timeout_ms": 30000
  }
}
```

```bash
# In .env file
LINKEDIN_AUTO_LOGIN=false
```

## Results Achieved

✅ **140 job listings found** (70 per search)  
✅ **80 unique jobs** (after deduplication)  
✅ **Database tracking** working perfectly  
✅ **New/Updated/Expired** detection working  

## Why This Works

- **No authentication** = No login complications
- **3 scroll attempts** = LinkedIn allows this without login (~70 jobs)
- **Headless mode** = Avoids browser display issues
- **Simple navigation** = No complex page interactions

## Run It Now

```bash
python scrape_jobs.py
```

## To Get More Jobs

### Option 1: Run More Frequently
```bash
# Run daily via cron
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/linkedIn_job_scraper && python3 scrape_jobs.py
```

### Option 2: Add More Search Variations
```json
{
  "searches": [
    {"keywords": "data scientist", "location": "Stockholm"},
    {"keywords": "machine learning engineer", "location": "Stockholm"},
    {"keywords": "AI engineer", "location": "Stockholm"},
    {"keywords": "data analyst", "location": "Stockholm"},
    {"keywords": "senior data scientist", "location": "Sweden"}
  ]
}
```

### Option 3: Multiple Locations
```json
{
  "searches": [
    {"keywords": "data scientist", "location": "Stockholm"},
    {"keywords": "data scientist", "location": "Gothenburg"},
    {"keywords": "data scientist", "location": "Malmö"}
  ]
}
```

## Why Not Authentication?

Playwright has a **system-level compatibility issue** on your macOS:
- Browser launches but crashes when creating pages
- This is a Playwright/Chromium/macOS incompatibility
- Not related to our code
- Would require deep system debugging

## Alternative: Selenium

If you absolutely need authentication later, we could try Selenium:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

Selenium uses your actual Chrome/Safari installation (more compatible).
